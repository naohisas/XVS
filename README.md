# XVS
XVS (eXcel-based Visualization System) is a new educational system of computer graphics and scientific visualization techniques that uses Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. In our system, the worksheet is used for the rendering window, for calculating the transformation matrices and for vertex transformation.

The main characteristics of our system are as follows:

* Users can intuitively understand the table-driven algorithm that uses look-up tables, such as in isosurface extraction, by using the worksheet.
* Because the rendering processes can be visually shown on the worksheet in our system, users can learn the rendering pipeline, which is implemented as a fixed processing stage sequence on a GPU, and is hard to learn using only graphics APIs such as OpenGL.
* By using our Excel-based system, users can efficiently learn the basis of computer graphics and scientific visualization techniques by using commodity PCs.
